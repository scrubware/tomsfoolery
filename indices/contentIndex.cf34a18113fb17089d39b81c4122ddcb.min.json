Upon losing one's legs, societally all people are treated as not completely human. In addition, legless individuals are unable to summon or wield [[Mystic Weapons]].\n\nIt is also possible for one's Soul and mind to become separated, through a number of methods, such as supplanting legs or supplanting a mind. A mind acts on the same accords as the Soul but is left without any connection to the [[Planes]] beyond [[Lantemar]], the Gods, or the heart of Eylant.\n\nReuniting a mind and Soul when the body is left completely unharmed is relatively easy. When physical damage is done however, the task becomes extraordinarily difficult.\n\nThese Soulless individuals are also unable to enter visions, or even experience supernatural super-planal events like the [[Arkhaos Cloud]] or godly visions.\n\nSoulless who die before becoming reunited become poor, afterlife-roaming lower halves, without minds to think. Only instinctual behaviors, and no capacity to experience the joys that any [[Religion]] on Lantemar brings.\n\nFurther experimentation may yield more specific results.","lastmodified":"2023-06-13T04:17:06.098145626Z","tags":["world","mystic","religion","planal-science","inventory"]},"/Arkhaos-Cloud":{"title":"Arkhaos Cloud","content":"The Arkhaos Cloud threatens to turn every living thing into a servant of doom, corrupting their minds and enslaving their wills.

On paper. Find the relics of the Stormkeep.\nThis is the ancient Stalniric device that should be able to trap the storm.\n\nThere are four relics required to activate the Stormkeep.\n- A pendant made of wood that shines like crystal, shaped like the forboding raven.\n- A perfect hollow glass triamid.\n- An obsidian handkerchief, that always appears when needed.\n- A golden string that cannot be tied.\n\nThe Stormkeep can *trap* the storm. This should be enough, for generations. However, in the distant future, the storm could come back, and ravage the land again.\n\n\n#### The Stormnodes (Intermediate)\nThis would be the way to disable the storm itself.\nThere are two Stormnodes. Each one is heavily guarded and requires a Node Crystal to activate.\nThere are three Node Crystals. Each one has been entrusted with one of Arkhaos' closest servants. His inner circle of Men.\n\nThese would disable the storm, according to Seerist gospel. They do not stop Arkhaos from ever making a storm again, but it will likely be centuries.\n\n\n#### The Benefactor (Pacifist)\nIf you could convice the Overseer or Petolani, Gods of Gods, to strip Arkhaos' power, you could vanquish the storm and save the World of Men. This would require much stealth, information gathering, archeology of old religion, and care.\n\nAnd what if Arkhaos finds another way? You'd be hard-pressed to convince the Overseer again. They tend not to interfere with the mortals whom they grows more and more dissatisfied with.\n\n\n#### The Slaughterers (Genocide)\nYou very well could slay Arkhaos himself, on another Plane of existence, if you had the right weaponry. This could be done by opening the Astral Gateway. You would need to collect weapons from likely some of Arkhaos's own keeps to do the deed.\n\nBut who will fill the void of power? Not you, surely. It could be some eviler force. Perchance.\n\n#### The Old Gods (Feast of Knowledge)\nFind the truth about the world. Discover what gods lie in Akamar, bind their wills to be the same as yours.\nA world shrouded in mystery. This is the path of the Scholar.\n\n#### True Retribution (Ultra Nightmare)\nYou want to destroy the storm.\nYou're sick of half-attempts.\nIt's time to do this once and for all.\n\nFind the relics, unlock the Stormnodes, open the Gateway.\nSlay the Bringer of Darkness.\nLock his power forever in the Stormkeep, with the Overseer's own binding blessing of law.\nFortunately for you, many of the places you need to go in any other path coincide.\n\nThe hardest mission you could take.\nBut forever, darkness will be stripped from the World of Men.\nA new era. A new beginning. True Retribution.\n\n\n\n\nCourse, if ye' really want ter' stop the storm, ye' could always just ask Arkhaos nicely.","lastmodified":"2023-06-13T04:17:06.098145626Z","tags":["storm","relics","world"]},"/Laniism":{"title":"Laniism (Religion)","content":"### Animistic/Polytheistic\n\nLaniism is one of the two Major Religions in the world of [[Lantemar]].

Many consider their faith unfounded, but Stalists often have the strongest faiths and the strongest wills out of any beings. Stalists know that while Stalnir can be wrong, he usually knows the best route humans should take. \n\nAnyone outside of Stalism disrespect Stalnir and his knowledge, due to Stalnir losing his godly powers and being considered ‘dead’.
