They are a violent group and conduct brutal ordinances to their own initiates. Most Arkists do not want to be transformed into Arkens, because they consider themselves to be chosen to assist with the transformation. They follow select scripture from the [[Book of Light (Abridged)]] and follow the complete writings of the [[Book of Dooms]]. This group acknowledges that the other gods exist but consider their lord Arkhaos to be the epitome of holiness, with Arkna being considered as a lesser deity. They pull from the power of Arkna to complete many tasks.","lastmodified":"2023-05-04T00:25:29.124111467Z","tags":[]},"/Book-of-Dooms":{"title":"Book of Dooms","content":"\n### An Archivist's Prologue:\n\n\u003e The full magnitude of the Book of Dooms has not been preserved over time. The small fragments and verses contained within this text are considered to be some the most important, or at least, the most well-preserved. These are the core teachings presented to most congegrations of Arkhists, but not neccesarily the only teachings.\n\n\nYe, the youngest borne, ye, the fresh one's mighty grasp!\nEver drips the storm upon, through the gaping holes in the heart, seeping in, ever in, to the fetid grips of courage and boldness whomsoever finds themselves in this world of men posesses.\n\nFear the storm, or not, it matters not. The storm finds us all the same.\nThe storm above! It falls so we may rise!\n\nThe swirling mists, hearken to their words of angels and light!\nFor Arkhaos, ye, the King of Hearts!\n\nBow, or be bowed!\n\nFear, or be feared!\n\nChoose your path.\nTwo present themselves to every heart in his domain.\nPerish by the grip, or serve by the heart!\n\nFor he clutches each of us, the Light One's creations, in his hand.\nThe Light One we must snuff out! For he is the true opressor. The ever-encroaching dominator over Man!\n\nWhen you, wily heart, find yourself within the abolitioner's redolant hand, take the path that leads your soul enlighted, and not wrought from the pleasures his kingdom brings us.\n\nBeware the soldiers of the Light. His merry band of insolents. They seek to brighten our path with wretched rays and ways. Do not fear the Light. Punish it, teach it why it wronged you, and wreak tenfold upon it! For the time has come where the Light One's grasp shall weaken, and his band shall attempt the destruction of the King's Scepter, the Storm, the mighty fog to which we bow and are blessed!\n\nDestroy this Light.\nDo this, and become whole.","lastmodified":"2023-05-04T00:25:29.124111467Z","tags":[]},"/Book-of-Light-Abridged":{"title":"Book of Light (Abridged)","content":"\u003eWhimsy\n\nAvast ye merry people of the land, the world, and the sky.\nThe world arises, opens, and unfolds into our gaping grasp.\n\nDark times advance with the rise and fall of the sky's light, yea, even the light of the people.\n\n\n\u003eAnew\n\nAnd the land was broke amongst them, the one converged to four, and the might and power divided into - amongst and within - the four.\n\nAnd these four were.\n\nAnd they were Arkhaos, and Vishna, and Kashna, and Stalnir.\nAnd the one from which it all became, the Overseer, did become as well.\nAnd the bridge between the land and the heavens, Arkhna too.\n\nAnd to the land came Vishna first, abiding there as nature deep.\nAnd then too came Kashna's breath, inviting structure and reform.\n\nTo fill the world with greater things, Stalnir walked upon the land, with his gift came the people there, and more.

On paper. Find the relics of the Stormkeep.\nThis is the ancient Stalniric device that should be able to trap the storm.\n\nThere are four relics required to activate the Stormkeep.\n- A pendant made of wood that shines like crystal, shaped like the forboding raven.\n- A perfect hollow glass triamid.\n- An obsidian handkerchief, that always appears when needed.\n- A golden string that cannot be tied.\n\nThe Stormkeep can *trap* the storm. This should be enough, for generations. However, in the distant future, the storm could come back, and ravage the land again.\n\n\n#### The Stormnodes (Intermediate)\nThis would be the way to disable the storm itself.\nThere are two Stormnodes. Each one is heavily guarded and requires a Node Crystal to activate.\nThere are three Node Crystals. Each one has been entrusted with one of Arkhaos' closest servants. His inner circle of Men.\n\nThese would disable the storm, according to Seerist gospel. They do not stop Arkhaos from ever making a storm again, but it will likely be centuries.\n\n\n#### The Benefactor (Pacifist)\nIf you could convice the Overseer or Petolani, Gods of Gods, to strip Arkhaos' power, you could vanquish the storm and save the World of Men. This would require much stealth, information gathering, archeology of old religion, and care.\n\nAnd what if Arkhaos finds another way? You'd be hard-pressed to convince the Overseer again. They tend not to interfere with the mortals whom they grows more and more dissatisfied with.\n\n\n#### The Slaughterers (Genocide)\nYou very well could slay Arkhaos himself, on another Plane of existence, if you had the right weaponry. This could be done by opening the Astral Gateway. You would need to collect weapons from likely some of Arkhaos's own keeps to do the deed.\n\nBut who will fill the void of power? Not you, surely. It could be some eviler force. Perchance.\n\n#### The Old Gods (Feast of Knowledge)\nFind the truth about the world. Discover what gods lie in Akamar, bind their wills to be the same as yours.\nA world shrouded in mystery. This is the path of the Scholar.\n\n#### True Retribution (Ultra Nightmare)\nYou want to destroy the storm.\nYou're sick of half-attempts.\nIt's time to do this once and for all.\n\nFind the relics, unlock the Stormnodes, open the Gateway.\nSlay the Bringer of Darkness.\nLock his power forever in the Stormkeep, with the Overseer's own binding blessing of law.\nFortunately for you, many of the places you need to go in any other path coincide.\n\nThe hardest mission you could take.\nBut forever, darkness will be stripped from the World of Men.\nA new era. A new beginning. True Retribution.\n\n\n\n\nCourse, if ye' really want ter' stop the storm, ye' could always just ask Arkhaos nicely.","lastmodified":"2023-05-04T00:25:29.124111467Z","tags":[]},"/Laniism":{"title":"Laniism","content":"### Animistic/Polytheistic\n\nSeerism is one of the two Major Religions in the world of [[Lantemar]].

Many consider their faith unfounded, but Stalists often have the strongest faiths and the strongest wills out of any beings. Stalists know that while Stalnir can be wrong, he usually knows the best route humans should take. Anyone outside of Stalism disrespect Stalnir and his knowledge, due to Stalnir losing his godly powers and being considered ‘dead’. He continues to roam the land, seeking to spread his message and preaching to his Stalists. Stalists may also worship other gods, and consider them to be on the same level, but with other duties not as related to mankind (and other humanoid races). They are similar to the Seerists with a focus on Stalnir, and the saving of pure life. Stalists cannot be brought back from the dead.","lastmodified":"2023-05-04T00:25:29.124111467Z","tags":[]}}
