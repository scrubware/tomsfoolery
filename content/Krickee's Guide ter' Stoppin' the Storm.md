Well, thar' be quite a few ways to stop the storm milads.
But I'll be goin' over the methods most prominently discussed.

#### The Relics (Easy)
This way is pretty simple. On paper. Find the relics of the Stormkeep.
This is the ancient Stalniric device that should be able to trap the storm.

There are four relics required to activate the Stormkeep.
- A pendant made of wood that shines like crystal, shaped like the forboding raven.
- A perfect hollow glass triamid.
- An obsidian handkerchief, that always appears when needed.
- A golden string that cannot be tied.

The Stormkeep can *trap* the storm. This should be enough, for generations. However, in the distant future, the storm could come back, and ravage the land again.


#### The Stormnodes (Intermediate)
This would be the way to disable the storm itself.
There are two Stormnodes. Each one is heavily guarded and requires a Node Crystal to activate.
There are three Node Crystals. Each one has been entrusted with one of Arkhaos' closest servants. His inner circle of Men.

These would disable the storm, according to Seerist gospel. They do not stop Arkhaos from ever making a storm again, but it will likely be centuries.


#### The Benefactor (Pacifist)
If you could convice the Overseer or Petolani, Gods of Gods, to strip Arkhaos' power, you could vanquish the storm and save the World of Men. This would require much stealth, information gathering, archeology of old religion, and care.

And what if Arkhaos finds another way? You'd be hard-pressed to convince the Overseer again. They tend not to interfere with the mortals whom they grows more and more dissatisfied with.


#### The Slaughterers (Genocide)
You very well could slay Arkhaos himself, on another Plane of existence, if you had the right weaponry. This could be done by opening the Astral Gateway. You would need to collect weapons from likely some of Arkhaos's own keeps to do the deed.

But who will fill the void of power? Not you, surely. It could be some eviler force. Perchance.

#### The Old Gods (Feast of Knowledge)
Find the truth about the world. Discover what gods lie in Akamar, bind their wills to be the same as yours.
A world shrouded in mystery. This is the path of the Scholar.

#### True Retribution (Ultra Nightmare)
You want to destroy the storm.
You're sick of half-attempts.
It's time to do this once and for all.

Find the relics, unlock the Stormnodes, open the Gateway.
Slay the Bringer of Darkness.
Lock his power forever in the Stormkeep, with the Overseer's own binding blessing of law.
Fortunately for you, many of the places you need to go in any other path coincide.

The hardest mission you could take.
But forever, darkness will be stripped from the World of Men.
A new era. A new beginning. True Retribution.




Course, if ye' really want ter' stop the storm, ye' could always just ask Arkhaos nicely.
