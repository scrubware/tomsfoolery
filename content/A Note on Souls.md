It is proved in science, theology, and magic that the Soul is directly bound to one's legs. Upon losing one's legs, societally all people are treated as not completely human. In addition, legless individuals are unable to summon or wield [[Mystic Weapons]].

It is also possible for one's Soul and mind to become separated, through a number of methods, such as supplanting legs or supplanting a mind. A mind acts on the same accords as the Soul but is left without any connection to the [[Planes]] beyond [[Lantemar]], the Gods, or the heart of Eylant.

Reuniting a mind and Soul when the body is left completely unharmed is relatively easy. When physical damage is done however, the task becomes extraordinarily difficult.

These Soulless individuals are also unable to enter visions, or even experience supernatural super-planal events like the [[Arkhaos Cloud]] or godly visions.

Soulless who die before becoming reunited become poor, afterlife-roaming lower halves, without minds to think. Only instinctual behaviors, and no capacity to experience the joys that any [[Religion]] on Lantemar brings.

Further experimentation may yield more specific results.
