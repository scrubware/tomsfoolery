### Monotheistic
Stalists primarily worship Stalnir. They believe in vanquishing abominations and heavily study the Book of Light. They practice ordinances and many seek to find Stalnir to seek advice. Stalists directly oppose Arkhaos and consider Arkens ‘the enemy’. Stalists believe in no afterlife and seek to get the most potential out of life. Many consider their faith unfounded, but Stalists often have the strongest faiths and the strongest wills out of any beings. Stalists know that while Stalnir can be wrong, he usually knows the best route humans should take. Anyone outside of Stalism disrespect Stalnir and his knowledge, due to Stalnir losing his godly powers and being considered ‘dead’. He continues to roam the land, seeking to spread his message and preaching to his Stalists. Stalists may also worship other gods, and consider them to be on the same level, but with other duties not as related to mankind (and other humanoid races). They are similar to the Seerists with a focus on Stalnir, and the saving of pure life. Stalists cannot be brought back from the dead.
