Added Damage = 1d10 - 2 + STR > 0

The user can predict an event, as many as `# of mysticism points / 2` per long rest.

When the event has happened, the user obtains a special D4 they can add to any roll that happens during combat.

The events in question must be specific enough to the DM's scrutiny, and should follow your character's belief. Think of it more as an alarm system, rather than a gamble.
