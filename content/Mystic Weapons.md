Mystic Weapons are soul-bound weapons whose properties can be attached to any weapon of choice.

Additionally, any Mystic Weapon can be attached to any spellcasting focus.
However, this ability only assists SOME spells, at the DM's approval.

Mystic Weapons must be UNBOUND to be attached to one's soul.
Mystic Weapons can be *lent out* with the explicit, conscious consent of their hosts. An unconscious or otherwise preoccupied host cannot lend a mystic weapon.
(Specifically, a lent weapon like [[The Warden's Vault of Souls]] remains bound to its host, [[Ren'owa Arkhana, Master of Blades]])

Mystic Weapons use Mysticism points, which are required for some abilities.

Your number of Mysticism points per long rest is equal to `LVL - 1, > 0.

If you have previously attached your mystic weapon to a standard weapon, you can attach it to a new weapon WITHOUT needing your previous one.
