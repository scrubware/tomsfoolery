All players have recieved the [[Dinner Invitation]]

Duke Penchforth proceeds as follows:

---

Welcome! Welcome. I've gathered you all here today as a part of my annual givings feast!
Things are going well this season, so I bear no opening remarks!
As always, we'll have audiences in groups. Starting with...
hmm... you six!

Enjoy the dinner!

---

You might be thinking. Why you seven?
Why were we invited to the feast?

Well, I've had my 'eyes in the sky' looking out for potential... recruits
And you happen to be my picks.

Have you heard of the news lately?
The storm from the East. It threatens to ravage my empire. Frankly, I don't see anyone doing anything about it. As a devout Stalist myself, I find it my duty to do something about this.

*ALLOW INTRODUCTIONS*

If you manage to contain this storm, I am eternally in your gratitude. We're talking money, fortunes, and not only the most attractive women in the region, but the most kindhearted as well.

Think of me as your wishing well. That is, if you can catch lightning in a jar. Metaphorically.

I care not of your religion. Any sect, and belief, any gods. Use the [[Lani'okaja]] for all I care! But heart of mine condemned, I will fulfill your hearts' desires if this quest be fulfilled.

Assuming the Book of Light to be true, I have an item you will need in your journey. Take this.
*The Duke hands the party the Golden String.*


Stay a short while, enjoy yourselves, get to know each other a bit better. But be on your way. The storm encroaches, and there is little time left.

---

As you exit the Duke's Feast, you spot a silhouette in the corner, that seems to vanish the moment your eyes turn away.


Later, the group encounters a salesman.
"Hey. Hey! You guys heard about the Doomstorm? It's coming to ravage the town!"
"I wish someone could "


The party stumbles into [[Ren'owa Arritheph, Master of Blades]]

Ren proceeds as follows:

---

Well hello there. I see you're the group the Duke's had his eyes on for quite some time!

I'm Master Ren'owa Arrithepth, the Blademaster some call me. I need help escorting an item to Mulakar. Help with any trouble I may encounter on the way. Informal bodyguards, I suppose.
