 All players have recieved the [[Dinner Invitation]]

Duke Penchforth proceeds as follows:

---

Welcome! Welcome. I've gathered you all here today as a part of my annual givings feast!
Things are going well this season, so I bear no opening remarks!
As always, we'll have audiences in groups. Starting with...
hmm... you eight!

Enjoy the dinner!

---

You might be thinking. Why you eight?
Why were we invited to the feast?

Well, I've been looking far and wide for a merry band of sorts to help me stop the Arkhaos Cloud.
You lads are that band!
Though I know you all well, you've yet to really meet each other. Introduce yourselves!


*ALLOW INTRODUCTIONS*

And of course, this is Benny. I think you'll all come to quite like Benny. Go ahead, introduce yourself.

Benny
- Loves drinking and buying drinks for people
- Caring and kind
- Mischevious little scamp
- Friend of the Duke's Son (who is off in battle)


Anyway, to business.

Have you heard of the news lately?
The storm from the East. It threatens to ravage my empire. Frankly, I don't see anyone doing anything about it. As a devout Stalist myself, I find it my duty to do something.

And realistically, it's going to hit my kingdom first.

If you manage to contain this storm, I am eternally in your gratitude. We're talking money, fortunes, and not only the most attractive women in the region, but the most kindhearted as well.

Think of me as your wishing well. That is, if you can catch lightning in a jar. Metaphorically.

I care not of your religion. Any sect, and belief, any gods. Use the [[Lani'okaja Theses]] for all I care! But heart of mine condemned, I will fulfill your hearts' desires if this quest be fulfilled.

Assuming the Book of Light to be true, I have an item you will need in your journey. Take this.
*The Duke hands the party the Golden String.*

And of course, a Book of Light to guide you.

Stay a short while, enjoy yourselves, get to know each other a bit better. But be on your way. The storm encroaches, and there is little time left.


AS THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF THINGS TO DO AT THE FEAST, SOUND THE TIEFLING RAID WARNING


As you exit the Duke's Feast, you spot a silhouette in the corner, that seems to vanish the moment your eyes turn away.


Later, the group encounters a salesman.
"Hey. Hey! You guys heard about the Doomstorm? It's coming to ravage the town!"

"Now look, I know a guy who can you get you outa here! Just 100 gold pieces per head! We'll take ya' straight to Mulakar, and get you as far northwest as the land allows!"


The party stumbles into [[Ren'owa Arkhana, Master of Blades]]

Ren proceeds as follows:

Well hello there. I see you're the group the Duke's had his eyes on for quite some time!

I'm Master Ren'owa Arrithepth, the Blademaster some call me. I need help escorting an item to Moon Brooke. Help with any trouble I may encounter on the way. Informal bodyguards, I suppose.

Would you like to accompany me? Passage in exchange for work.

Excellent!
