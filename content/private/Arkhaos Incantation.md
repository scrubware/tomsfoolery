The end is never the end

The vortex and that beyond flows

Our Lord and Savior shares his light

Twisted into something new

Good morning new horizons

Farewell to jesters mocking the sky

The bluebird sings like a blood-filled storm

The hour to slay the weepers has come

The giant's drink is vast and wide

My visage shattered, torn, anew

The end is never the end is never the end.
