The Arkhaos Cloud threatens to turn every living thing into a servant of doom, corrupting their minds and enslaving their wills. Note that this does not override their ability to think, and to deny the cloud. If you escape the cloud before it is too late, you may be fine.

The two [[Religion]]s of the world prophesy the storm's coming. [[Laniism]] and [[Seerism]]. These religions have many sects, which believe many things. Both have ways to stop the storm.
