Master Ren is a fearsome opponent.
He is a dark freelancer, who has heavy ties with the [[Arkhist Guards]].

Ren owns many blades, all of which he contains within a singular hilt.
Omni Omnex, he calls it.


Omni Omnex is a magical hilt, that at will, can summon any blade the user has collected, reforming the sword (save for the hilt) in its' place.

Mystical Weapons use Mysticism points, which are required for some abilities.
Your number of Mysticism points per long rest is equal to `LVL - 1, > 0'.

The Omni Omnex currently contains many Mystical Swords:

 - The Warden's Vault of Souls (LVL + DEX / 2)
	 - If the user deals a killing blow to a being with this weapon, they can trap their soul in an astral box. 
	 - Only one soul can be captured per long rest.
	 - Two souls can be resummoned using one Mysticism point.
	 - When captured, the host body fades away.
	 - When released, the host body emerges from the ground.
 - The Liar's Only Love (1d4 + CHA + 1)
	 - The user can anticipate their opponent's next action, expending one Mysticism point, dodging their attack entirely. This ability is subjective to circumstance.
	 - The weapon stirs confidence in the bearer, causing +3 initiative and +1 to-hit.
 - The Guardsman's Only Key (1d10 - 1 + STR)
	 - The user can detect if a prescribed event has happened, once per long rest.
	 - When the event has happened, the user gains +1 Mysticism point.
 - The Daytime's Final Tears (1d8 + STR - 1)
	 - When the user is in view of the Sun, the bearer can expend two Mysticism points to inflict 1d4 + LVL fire damage for 3 turns to the opponent on hit.
 - The Lover's Last Affair (1d8 + DEX)
	 - If the user has recently recovered from a breakup, and the user successfully lands an attack on an opponent, they gain 4 Mysticism points.
 - The Bleeding Moon (1d12, flat)
	 - When ambient light is comparable to nighttime, on a successful hit, the user causes the opponent to bleed. This deals 2 extra damage on all subsequent attacks. If an opponent is killed with this weapon while they are bleeding, you gain 1 Mysticism point.
 - The Soldier's Final Hurrah
 - The Sun, Earth, and Sky
