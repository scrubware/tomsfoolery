People do not often travel the planes. Only skilled Planewalkers, of which there are believed to be less than a dozen. Of course, seeking guide from one of these may help someone on their journey. But there is little to do in the planes. Lant is for mortals and Akamar is for gods. The rest is simply the universe trying its best not to shatter into particles and dust.
