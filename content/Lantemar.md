The known world! Lantemar is what the people call the known reaches of the planetoid they have explored, or Eylant in some more ancient texts.

The people who live in the place they call Lantemar know very little about the cosmos. They presume they are the only astral body, save for a single sun and two moons. They call the planet Lant, and they call the land Lantemar. No sailors have advanced far into the oceans, and it is unknown if there is more land to be found.

There are nine kingdoms (and one silly group!) of Lantemar.

Damara (Human)
Rashemla (Human)
Mulakar (Human)

Moonbrook (Elven)
The Great Oak (High Elven)

Annelundra (Dragonborn)
Turnuroth (Dragonborn)

Timber's Den (Gnomish)
Folklin's Den (Rock Gnomish)

Myuirtos (Tiefling Cultists)

Other races live on Lantemar but none have built kingdoms on the scale of these 10.
