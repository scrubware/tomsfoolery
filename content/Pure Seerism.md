### Polytheistic
Pure Seerists are the most common sect of Seerism. They follow the teachings of the Book of Light and consider all gods to be important, with the Overseer being the most important among them. They follow many bare teachings of the ancient ‘Christianity’, modified to suit the group of gods that now command existence.
