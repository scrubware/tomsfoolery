Added Damage = 1d4 + CHA + 1

The user can anticipate their opponent's next action, expending two Mysticism points, dodging their attack entirely. This ability is subjective to circumstance, and can only be done once per long rest.

The weapon can also be used for a limited kind of future sight, wherein an enemy's or environmental object's actions become predetermined. *This* ability can only be used once per long rest in addition to it's combat ability, and is subject to the DM's scrutiny.

The weapon stirs confidence in the bearer, causing +3 initiative and +1 to-hit.
