- Lant – Physical Plane
	- This realm holds all physical matter. Extraphysical matter does exist outside of this realm, while physical matter can although it does not.
- Akamar – Godly Plane
	- Exists above the material plane. All deities and Quasi-deities live here.
- Arkhamar – Magical Plane
	- A sector of Akamar, this is where magical power is pulled from.
- Leyanar - Imperfection Plane
	- A plane made manifest as the inverse to Laniist "Thesis of the Air" (see [[Lani'okaja Theses]]), or the genesis from Arkhaos, it is the place where imperfection lies. Some choose to embrace this and seek out this plane. It is a deep purple, crystalline place, made of abstract vice manifest.
- Deiusmar – Death Plane
	- Souls immediately enter this realm after death. Different sects believe in different purposes of Deiusmar.
- Eilemar – Elemental Plane
	- Magical creatures are conjured here.
	- It is a sector of Arkhamar.
- Elysimar – Travel Plane
	- This is above Mortem and can be used to quickly travel between many locations in the Physical, Elemental, and Magical planes.

People do not often travel the planes. Only skilled Planewalkers, of which there are believed to be less than a dozen. Of course, seeking guide from one of these may help someone on their journey. But there is little to do in the planes. Lant is for mortals and Akamar is for gods. The rest is simply the universe trying its best not to shatter into particles and dust.
