### Animistic/Polytheistic

Seerism is one of the two Major Religions in the world of [[Lantemar]]. Laniists follow the [[Lani'okaja]] and, in total, four deities:

 - Akalani (Greater Deity)
	 - God of the Wild and Change.
	 - Allows motion, force, and change.
	 - Ensures the world is never static.
	 - Not truly chaos but inspires it.
	 - Bringer of the Archaos Cloud
	 - Ideals include pursuit of self-worth, journey before destination, and going with the flow.
 - Okolani (Greater Deity)
	 - God of Thoughts and Souls.
	 - Not knowledge, but intent.
	 - All consciousnesses are a part of Okolani.
	 - Controls emotions, instincts, and feelings.
	 - Okolani is the life force of creatures but only the thoughts of humanoids.
 - Petolani (Greater Deity)
	 - Only the highest priests understand what Petolani’s domain is.
	 - Petolani is considered to be perfection.
 - Lani’eni (Lesser Deity)
	 - Messenger and Scribe for the Gods.
	 - Supervisor of the Afterlife.
	 - Consulter of men.
	 - Lani’eni is said to be able to manifest itself in multiple locations, and in multiple forms, to deliver messages simultaneously. This doctrine is used to assuage beliefs in Seerist gods.
