### Polytheistic

The goal of Laniism is to become one with the three greater deities, Akalani, Okolani, and Petolani, by studying the doctrine of Lani’okaka, sent from the heavens by Lani’eni. Meditation and self-discovery are focuses of theology, in addition to accepting that you must overcome the instability of this world to join the peace that is in the next. Members of Laniism believe that everything in this world has a soul, and they are all a piece of Okolani. After death, Laniists will join the three gods and be given freedom to persue their own passions. Non-believers will be left to remain on Earth.
