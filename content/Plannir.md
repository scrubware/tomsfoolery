A magnificent astral body, Plannir is the physical manifestation of the [[Planes]] beyond Lant. Plannir works as a series of orbiting shells, each one containing a plane layered deeper and deeper. 

Of course, these are not the planes themselves, merely the energetic representation of them visible from Lant. The sole exception to this is the outermost plane, the outermost shell of Plannir, Elysimar, which when passed through leads to the legitamate planes. Planewalkers utilize magic to travel to Plannir, and then pass to the other planes. 

Plannir is the planar gateway to the physical world, Lant.

All of Plannir has no pragmatic effect on the world's climate or extraterrestrial interactions, other than blocking [[Sunnir]]'s visibility, causing [[Eclipses]].
