Master Ren is a fearsome opponent.
He is a dark freelancer, who has heavy ties with [[Arkhism]], and Tiefling Cultists.

He can seemingly teleport at will, carry countless weight, and strike a foe down in a single hit. He does much of this through the manipulation of a specially designed weapon he constructed, called the Omni Omnex.

The Omni Omnex is a magical sword hilt, that at will, can summon any blade the user has collected, reforming the sword's cutting edge atop the magical hilt.

The Omni Omnex can switch weapons by spending the user's Reaction.

Ren'owa uses the Omnex primarily to store his catalog of [[Mystic Weapons]], which he uses to manipulate the world and reach a god-among-men status.

He is in possession of one of the [[Four Relics]], and who knows what other kinds of magical abilities.

He can be summoned using the [[Ren Bell]].

Little else is known about the swordsman.
