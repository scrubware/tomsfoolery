### Monotheistic
Arkists are a cult-like group, even calling themselves a cult on occasions, who embrace the coming of the [[Arkhaos Cloud]] and wish to seek recognition from Arkhaos himself. They are a violent group and conduct brutal ordinances to their own initiates. Most Arkists do not want to be transformed into Arkens, because they consider themselves to be chosen to assist with the transformation. They follow select scripture from the [[Book of Light (Abridged)]] and follow the complete writings of the [[Book of Dooms]]. This group acknowledges that the other gods exist but consider their lord Arkhaos to be the epitome of holiness, with Arkna being considered as a lesser deity. They pull from the power of Arkna to complete many tasks.
