>Thesis of the Air

From nothing, came Akalani.
The air appeared, and Akalani took form.
The embodiment of the new, the embodiment of change.
Akalani birthed our world.

A sea of energy, a screaming mass of O'loki, converged to create Okolani, the will of O'loki to have form.
Okolani in turn, gives form to all, and thought to most.

A writing storm of creation crystallizes into Petolani, the essence of the complete.
Not a raw force like her sisters, Petolani came to be the first form of the Gods.

The three came together, Y'roki in perfect form. And our world, Ey'lant was created.

From the air came the stone, from the stone came the soil, and the soil into water, and we now reside today.

>Thesis of K'rjopa

Akalani and Okolani are with us now, in our bodies.
The believers of lesser faiths may not carry Akalani with them, forced forever into a life of dullness.
The believers of lesser faiths may not carry Okolani with them, forced forever into a life of impluse.

Akalani will inspire you and change, Okalani will keep you right and taut.

It is for us to become closer to the Gods.
To accept their wills to replace ours.

Behold Lani'eni, the scribe for the Y'roki, Lani'eni brings us the gifts and wisdom of the Gods. Lani'eni sees all and protects the Gods' will.

Lani'eni brings doctrine from the Gods.

>Thesis of Cleanness

Ye followers, ye K'rjopa, take with you these teachings from Lani'eni and these teachings then too from the Gods.

Carry not the burden of sundered folk, bring yourself to the highest degree you find yourself capable. Okolani will correct you, bring you ability to reach higher as you find your limtis. The Gods will accept ye K'rjopa into their fold when you give up this world's lesser items from it.

These missteps are not of the Y'roki. They are to challenge you, an imperfect creation, to become perfect, in Peto-eye.

Follow the path of the righteous, ye K'rjopa, and stray not into the foliage of disbelief! The ripeness of imperfection's fruit decieves and misinforms ye K'rjopa of the true path.

Y'roki'lopu and to meet the Y'roki await at the door to Deiusmar, and the walkway to Akamar.

>Thesis of Y'roki

Word direct from Petolani to our Lani'n elder:
"Follow the theses.
This is the path to affection in Deiusmar.
This is the path to join Y'roki.

The Y'roki grow fuller every our-day with K'rjopan O'loki. You can join us too."
