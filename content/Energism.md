### Polytheistic
There are very few Energists, and very little is known about them. They worship Vishna, and respect all her decisions as law. Members of this sect are very relaxed and go with the flow. Nothing else is known of their practices, but they likely follow most of the practices found in the [[Book of Light (Abridged)]] which are also followed by the Seerists. They pull from the power of Arkhna to complete many tasks.
