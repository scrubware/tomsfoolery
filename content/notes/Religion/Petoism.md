### Monotheistic
The goal of Petoism is to persue clean activities, good behaviors, and to be of service. The reasoning of these actions is to become closer to Petolani, the true god of Petoism, and the creator of worlds. There is no true doctrine in Petoism, but the Lani’okaka isn’t dismissed as false, merely misguided. An alternate, but not widely accepted doctrine, preaches the ‘correct’ version of the Lani’okaka. Members of Laniism believe that everything in this world has a soul, and they are all a piece of Petolani. After death, Petoists will join Petolani and be filled with infinite knowledge and satisfaction. Non-believers will be left to remain on Earth or may be accepted by the lesser gods, Akalani and Okolani.
