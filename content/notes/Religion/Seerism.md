### Polytheistic

Seerism is one of the two Major Religions in the world of [[Lantemar]]. Seerists follow the [[Book of Light (Abridged)]] and, in total, six deities:

 - Arkhaos (Lesser Deity)
	 - God of Contention, Chaos, and Puzzles.
	 - Bringer of Arkhaos’ Cloud.
	 - Changes humanoids into Arkens.
	 - Conspired with Vishna and Kashna to create the dark creatures of the world, for their own amusement.
	 - Attempting to conquer the hearts of men to bring about his own regime.
 - Vishna (Lesser Deity)
	 - God of Energy and Flow.
	 - Life force of the Universe.
	 - Manifests as the Moon
	 - Cannot directly influence the world and must borrow help from her fellow gods.
	 - Can speak in the minds of mortals, but not immortals.
 - Kashna (Lesser Deity)
	 - God of Forces and Science.
	 - Forged the Earth from Vishna’s power.
 - Stalnir (Lesser Deity)
	 - God of Wisdom, Light, and Strategy.
	 - Forger of Men.
	 - Considered a dead or dying God, Stalnir manifests in mortal realms to recruit fighters against the Archaos Cloud. Few consider his plan worth the effort.
	 - Stalnir created man and humanoids, and thus considers the undead to be an abomination.
 - The Overseer (Greater Deity)
	 - Creator of Archaos, Vishna, Kashna, and Stalnir.
	 - Oversees the world and beyond but does not interfere.
 - Arkhna (Quasi Deity)
