There are two major religions in [[Lantemar]]. This document should be a full briefing on everything you need to know.

The [[Arkhaos Cloud]] threatens to turn every living thing into a servant of doom, corrupting their minds and enslaving their wills. According to the [[Book of Light (Abridged)]] and the [[Lani'okaja Theses]], the Arkhaos Cloud can be stopped by a group of adventurers, guided by Stalnir or Laniâ€™eni.

It is unknown which of the two religions was founded first. Sects of both seek to end the Arkhaos cloud and return life to normalcy. The question is, who is right?
