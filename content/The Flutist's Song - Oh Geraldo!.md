This is the tale of a horrible lad,
One who became more a "man",
Tried to be strong, tried to be good,
But fell for a more devious plan.

See Geraldo's poor wife,
Had once lost her legs,
In an accident, 
Deep in the mines,
So now on his wife,
Just not on her legs,
Our man still sexily serpentines,

He gets busy, with his legless wife,
Who lays for her days on his bed,
She sucks, and he plows, and generally,
They seem to do everything, but head.

Many a child, his wife oft did birth,
Spawned from Gerald's sinful craze,
He always had plowed, without a job,
Is she even still alive these days?

Who knows, but he'd probably be into that,
Old creepy Gerald-to-the-o,
Never employed, never worn a hardhat,
Somehow hornier than old Satano!

Never held a job,
Never paid his rent,
Never for his food,
A penny was spent,
He begs on the street,
Then he strokes his meat,
He thrives off of strangers,
And makes bank in the heat!

Too for his coin,
He sold each his kids,
To men who oft lurk in the night,

Until he woke,
In a dank and dark cage,
Kept til his days' end,
Never again to see light!

But he died after hope,
Had deceptively "came",
Claiming, to save him from chains,
But they cut off his legs!
And too his big cock!
Leaving nothing to defend his claims!

Then he died! Of blunt trauma!
Straight to the head!
10 seconds of thought left,
Then legally dead!

And the group left his corpse there!
With zero remorse!
Attaching a big sword, to
Replace his cock of course!

To tell you this tale,
Is why I play this flute,
Oh oh oh, oh Geraldo,
The pretty-much-a-male-prostitute!
Who died!
