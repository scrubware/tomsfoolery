### An Archivist's Prologue:

> The full magnitude of the Book of Dooms has not been preserved over time. The small fragments and verses contained within this text are considered to be some the most important, or at least, the most well-preserved. These are the core teachings presented to most congegrations of Arkhists, but not neccesarily the only teachings.


Ye, the youngest borne, ye, the fresh one's mighty grasp!
Ever drips the storm upon, through the gaping holes in the heart, seeping in, ever in, to the fetid grips of courage and boldness whomsoever finds themselves in this world of men posesses.

Fear the storm, or not, it matters not. The storm finds us all the same.
The storm above! It falls so we may rise!

The swirling mists, hearken to their words of angels and light!
For Arkhaos, ye, the King of Hearts!

Bow, or be bowed!

Fear, or be feared!

Choose your path.
Two present themselves to every heart in his domain.
Perish by the grip, or serve by the heart!

For he clutches each of us, the Light One's creations, in his hand.
The Light One we must snuff out! For he is the true opressor. The ever-encroaching dominator over Man!

When you, wily heart, find yourself within the abolitioner's redolant hand, take the path that leads your soul enlighted, and not wrought from the pleasures his kingdom brings us.

Beware the soldiers of the Light. His merry band of insolents. They seek to brighten our path with wretched rays and ways. Do not fear the Light. Punish it, teach it why it wronged you, and wreak tenfold upon it! For the time has come where the Light One's grasp shall weaken, and his band shall attempt the destruction of the King's Scepter, the Storm, the mighty fog to which we bow and are blessed!

Destroy this Light.
Do this, and become whole.
