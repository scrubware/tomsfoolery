In [[Lantemar]], the world revolves around its sun, [[Sunnir]], facing it nearly always. There are seasons in this world, but they have such a small effect that keeping their track is unreasonable. Often people superstitiously blame their misfortune on these seasons.

Despite this, there is still a day and night in the world.

Between the sun and Lant is [[Plannir]], the great big astral object that eclipses the sun's light for twelve of every 24 hours.

During each nightly eclipse, [[Sunnir]]'s light is blocked by the magnitude of [[Plannir]]. During this time, the [[Arkhaos Cloud]] is able to spread, now free from the light.
