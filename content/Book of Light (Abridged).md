>Whimsy

Avast ye merry people of the land, the world, and the sky.
The world arises, opens, and unfolds into our gaping grasp.

Dark times advance with the rise and fall of the sky's light, yea, even the light of the people.


>Anew

And the land was broke amongst them, the one converged to four, and the might and power divided into - amongst and within - the four.

And these four were.
And Eylant was.

And they were Arkhaos, and Vishna, and Kashna, and Stalnir.
And the one from which it all became, the Overseer, did become as well.
And the bridge between the land and the heavens, Arkhna too.

And to the land came Vishna first, abiding there as nature deep.
And then too came Kashna's breath, inviting structure and reform.

To fill the world with greater things, Stalnir walked upon the land, with his gift came the people there, and more. Too came light, and mind, and strength.

Lastly, the wily storm of contention came, Arkhaos did inflict the world with silver tongue and forces wrath.
Together with the siblings, save the strongest one of all, came the darkness there within.
And polarized the blinding good that rests in thirdborn's bosom.

And so the storm comes closer now, beyond the skydom's reach.
The four keys remaining there, whom seal divine breach.



>Anew II

Each the mighty gods above did send their gifts into the land. 
Others more than others.
And so the world came fuller still, a land for us to reap and sow.
To keep together, in peace, without greed or strife.

Keep these words well within your heart or lose your mortal grasp.



>Light

Stalnir, blessed, of the heavens. Birthed us here as so.
It gave us form, it gave us hope. It gives us more today.
Bring up your fellow person. Grow!
Ever closer to the light, to our Lords above.

Do not forget it in your worship. Stalnir is the Lord of Us.



>Darkness

O! O confound, O wrought rot and strife.
Arkhaos comes. It's power comes in tenfold now, this time shall cease but come again. The storm. It rages.

Heed this word. Arkhaos is mighty, and stops at very little save own worship, which is the most henious gift upon oneself to give.


>Darkness II

Prophets teach of time come again, where Arkhaos yet does rule the world of Eylant. His power grows and grows, until shadows' wit doth overtake mine and thine own.

Arkhaos is a King of Trickery. Do not be fooled.


>Finality

The world comes to a close eventually. This time comes soon or late.

Find Stalnir's keep. Trap the storm. Trap it, and find yourselves free. For it is the binder of men, and yet it must be bound by these men.
Otherwise, the reckoning of all peoples may be upon the world.
