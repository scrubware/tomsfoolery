### Animistic/Polytheistic

Laniism is one of the two Major Religions in the world of [[Lantemar]]. Laniists follow the [[Lani'okaja Theses]] and, in total, four deities:

 - Akalani (Greater Deity)
	 - God of the Wild and Change.
	 - Allows motion, force, and change.
	 - Ensures the world is never static.
	 - Not truly chaos but inspires it.
	 - Bringer of the Arkhaos Cloud in Laniism.
		 - Laniists do not have to agree with Akalani's bringing of the storm, but they acknowledge that it is the will of the Gods.
	 - Ideals include pursuit of self-worth, journey before destination, and going with the flow.
 - Okolani (Greater Deity)
	 - God of Thoughts and Souls.
	 - Not knowledge, but intent.
	 - All consciousnesses are a part of Okolani.
	 - Controls emotions, instincts, and feelings.
	 - Okolani is the life force of wild creatures, but only the thoughts of humanoids.
 - Petolani (Greater Deity)
	 - Only the highest priests understand what Petolani’s domain is.
	 - Petolani is considered to be perfection.
 - Lani’eni (Lesser Deity)
	 - Messenger and Scribe for the Gods.
	 - Supervisor of the Afterlife.
	 - Consulter of men.
	 - Lani’eni is said to be able to manifest itself in multiple locations, and in multiple forms, to deliver messages simultaneously. This doctrine is used to assuage beliefs in Seerist gods.

Listed below are the Sects of Laniism.
